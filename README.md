# BookSearchEngine

A Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Goal:

Re-factor existing code to use GraphQLqueries and mutations to fetch and modify data.

## Issues:

- The front end needs to be refactored as it is not linking up correctly with the back end.
- Heroku deployment was successful, however it did not build or display.

## Results:

I was able to use hooks and graphQL.
